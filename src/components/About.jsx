      <h2>About Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h2>
      <p>
        Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a widely used and evidence-based psychotherapy
        approach that focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and
        beliefs (cognitions) and replacing them with more adaptive and realistic ones. CBT is
        based on the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected, and
        that changing our thoughts can lead to changes in our emotions and behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
        CBT is effective in treating a variety of mental health conditions, including depression,
        anxiety disorders, PTSD, OCD, and more. It typically involves structured sessions
        with a therapist, where clients learn and practice specific cognitive and behavioral
        techniques to address their symptoms and improve their coping skills.

        Key components of CBT include identifying and challenging cognitive distortions,
        developing coping strategies, setting and working towards goals, and practicing
        relaxation and stress management techniques. CBT is often brief and focused, with
        treatment durations ranging from a few sessions to several months, depending on
        the individual's needs and goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, CBT empowers individuals to take an active role in managing their mental
        health and equips them with practical tools to navigate life's challenges and
        improve their overall well-being.
